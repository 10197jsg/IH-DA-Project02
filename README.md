# Vanguard A/B Test Project

## Overview
This project analyzes the impact of a redesigned digital interface for Vanguardâ€™s clients through a controlled A/B test. The goal was to determine if a more modern and intuitive digital design, with contextual prompts, led to improved client completion rates in an online process compared to the traditional user interface.

The analysis encompasses end-to-end data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), KPI definition, hypothesis testing, experiment evaluation, and dashboard/storytelling development using Tableau.

## Project Deliverables
- **EDA and Data Cleaning**
  - Merging client profile and web interaction datasets.
  - Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formatting.
- **Performance Metrics Definition**
  - Key metrics such as Completion Rates, Error Rates, and Average Time per Step.
- **Hypothesis Testing and Experiment Evaluation**
  - Hypothesis testing to assess the significance of improved completion rates.
  - Evaluation of experiment design, sample size sufficiency, and potential biases.
- **Tableau Dashboards and Story Creation**
  - Visual storytelling of the A/B test results.
  - Dynamic filtering by demographics (age, gender).
- **Final Project Presentation**
  - Insights, recommendations, and a detailed evaluation of experiment outcomes.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Statsmodels)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Tableau Public/Desktop
- Trello (Kanban Board for project management)
- Git & GitHub for version control and collaboration

## Data Sources
- **Client Profiles (df_final_demo.csv)**: Client ID, tenure, age, gender, account details.
- **Web Activity Logs (df_final_web_data_pt1.csv and df_final_web_data_pt2.csv)**: Digital footprints recording process steps, timestamps, and session details.
- **Experiment Assignment (df_final_experiment_clients.csv)**: Grouping information identifying Control and Test group clients.

Each record includes important metadata:
- `client_id`, `variation`, `visitor_id`, `visit_id`, `process_step`, `date_time`, `clnt_tenure_yr`, `clnt_age`, `gendr`, `num_accts`, `bal`, `calls_6_mnth`, `logons_6_mnth`
